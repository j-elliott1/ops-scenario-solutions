# Ops-Scenario-Solutions

Welcome to my repository of strategic operations scenarios and professional responses.

This collection showcases:
- Case-based thinking
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Real-world-ready operational playbooks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These are **conceptual deliverables** based on hypothetical scenarios and should not be reused for commercial or organizational gain without consent.

## Why This Repo?
These were originally completed as part of a professional assessment exercise. Rather than let them sit idle, I'm sharing them to demonstrate my analytical skills, operations knowledge, and practical documentation abilities.
